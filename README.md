# Add this!

Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
For example:

```
Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
 let addThis = function(num) {

 }
```
